# Pico's Rapture Description + Art List

## Basic Story  
The world has been raputured and everyone is going to Heaven as angels  
BUT, Pico and his friends have been left behind and are doomed to Hell  
They must use their weapons to climb up to Heaven by exploding angels

## Gameplay
- Tap/click somewhere to shoot a projectile in that direction
- Projectiles explode when they hit the ground or an angle
- Explosions blast you upwards, so you can use them to climb up
- Shooting in a direction also knocks you back, so you can move left/right and even hover by shooting
- There will always be new angels appearing as you climb, so you can climb infinitely
- Try to climb as high as possible
- (WISHLIST) Boss characters that appear every X angels that you kill, and fly around shooting at you
  - You have to shoot and kill them before they kill you
  - Killing them unlocks them as a playable characters
  - Killing them also steals their wings, which gives you a single automatic recovery if you fall too much

## Assets
### Angels
- Each angel is made up by taking random pieces from a big pool of parts and putting them together
  - Heads
  - Bodies
  - Legs/feet
- A wing flapping animation, shared between all angels
- A halo, shared between all angels

### Environment
- Background color gradient that changes as you climb. It should be dark/firey at the bottom (like Hell) and will clear up and become more Heaven-like as you climb up. Helps to see long-term progress.
- Clouds that randomly animate in the background. Helps to see short-term progress.
- The ground where you will have some sort of lava/Hellish look
- (WISHLIST) When you start a game, the ground/Hell opens up and spits out the character you chose

### UI
- Pico's Rapture logo
- Some way to select which character you want... maybe a thing at the bottom of the screen that you scroll horizontally through, and then tap the character you want?
- Current score tracker while playing
- Show previous best score vs current score when you lose
- Short, abstract little tutorial animations that are displayed when the player is on the ground and hasn't started climbing yet, that explain each of the following things:
  - Tapping shoots in that direction and knocks you back in the opposite direction
  - Shooting at stuff causes explosions that blast you upwards
  - Climb up as high as you can
